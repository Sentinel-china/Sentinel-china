In the context of a global shift toward a green and low-carbon energy structure, wind power—an important part of renewable energy—is experiencing continuous and rapid growth.  
To meet the dual demands for high reliability and efficiency, modern medium-to-large wind turbines widely adopt hydraulic systems, supporting core functions such as blade pitch adjustment, braking, and yaw control. These systems act as the “nervous center” of turbine operation.

In actual operation, hydraulic systems face multiple challenges, including high pressure, frequent starts and stops, and extreme weather.  
How to monitor key parameters in real time and control them precisely has become a core issue in ensuring the stable operation of wind power systems. SENTINEL’s intelligent sensor products based on IO-Link technology are providing strong support for the intelligent upgrade of wind turbine hydraulic systems.



## Multi-Dimensional Sensors Build the “Perceptive Brain” of Hydraulic Systems

The efficiency and safety of hydraulic systems depend on accurate sensing of multiple parameters and closed-loop feedback. Different types of sensors play complementary roles:

- **Pressure sensors** are the “gatekeepers” of safe operation, providing real-time pressure feedback to ensure that pitch and braking systems operate within set ranges, preventing equipment damage or control failure due to overpressure or underpressure.  
- **Temperature sensors** monitor hydraulic oil temperature, helping to detect oil degradation or overheating risks, thus avoiding seal aging or lubrication failure that could lead to leaks or malfunctions.  
- **Flow sensors** monitor hydraulic fluid flow status. Changes in flow rate can indirectly indicate dynamic issues such as pipeline blockages or valve sticking.



## IO-Link Leads the New Era of Smart Sensing

SENTINEL sensor products are designed specifically for wind power hydraulic applications, offering significant advantages in technical performance and system integration:

- Pressure sensors support working pressures up to 600 bar, with excellent dynamic response and resistance to mechanical vibration—ideal for the high-vibration environment inside wind turbine nacelles.  
- Pressure and temperature sensors are integrated with IO-Link functionality, enabling faster data transmission, simpler wiring, and smarter diagnostics. The IO-Link protocol supports automatic device recognition, remote parameter setting, and self-diagnosis, serving as a vital bridge for the digital transformation of sensors.  
- With an IP67 protection rating, these sensors can handle harsh outdoor environments such as oil exposure, high humidity, and challenging installation conditions, ensuring higher reliability.

Combined with online condition monitoring, SENTINEL sensors support real-time health analysis.  
When paired with edge computing or cloud-based AI algorithms, they can detect early failure signs such as friction or leakage, enabling proactive maintenance.



## Industry Case | Wind Turbine OEM in Eastern China

A wind turbine manufacturer in Eastern China adopted SENTINEL’s IO-Link smart sensor solution in its next-generation onshore wind turbines to optimize pitch and yaw hydraulic control systems.

During deployment, the engineering team found that in some wind farms, pitch systems frequently shut down in summer due to high oil temperatures. By introducing SENTINEL’s pressure and temperature sensors, the system achieved dynamic dual-parameter monitoring.  
When oil temperature exceeded 60°C, the system automatically triggered an alert and activated the cooling unit, significantly reducing unplanned downtime.

In addition, feedback from displacement sensors enabled the turbine’s main control system to establish a complete closed-loop pitch control logic, maintaining stable pitch during changing wind speeds and improving overall power generation efficiency.

**The project lead stated:**  
> “SENTINEL’s IO-Link smart sensors not only improved system response speed and data accuracy but also significantly simplified control cabinet wiring, making maintenance and system expansion much more convenient.”



## Looking Ahead: Hydraulic Systems Moving Toward Smart Maintenance

As the wind power industry develops toward higher capacity, larger scale, and greater intelligence, hydraulic sensing technology is also evolving. From single-point collection to system-wide integration, and from manual inspection to remote diagnostics, sensors are becoming the “perceptive core” of intelligent wind turbine operation.

SENTINEL will continue to focus on wind power applications, aiming for higher integration, stronger self-diagnosis capabilities, and higher protection levels with its IO-Link smart sensor solutions.  
In the future, wind turbine hydraulic systems will not only “see” but also “detect accurately and respond quickly,” fully supporting the intelligent transformation of renewable energy equipment.
