### Principle and Features

The vortex flow sensor is based on the Kármán vortex street effect, measuring flow by detecting the vortex frequency generated as fluid passes an obstruction.  
This design does not rely on fluid conductivity, making it highly advantageous for measuring water, gas, steam, and other media.

### Product Features

- **Dual Flow and Temperature Monitoring**: Simultaneously monitors flow and temperature, with three selectable flow ranges (2–16 L/min, 5–40 L/min, 10–100 L/min) and a temperature range of 0–100°C, with accuracies of 3% of full scale and 1°C respectively.  
- **High-Resolution IPS Display**: Supports four-direction switching for clear readability under complex installation conditions.  
- **Standard Interface and Communication**: Equipped with M12 A-coded 4-pin IO-Link interface; supports ISDU (Indexed Service) for remote parameter setting and real-time data reading.  
- **Cumulative Flow Recording**: Records up to 99,999 liters or m³, facilitating data analysis and traceability.  
- **Flexible Adaptability**: Offers multiple thread specifications to fit various pipe sizes; switch outputs support NO/NC, NPN/PNP/push-pull configurations to meet diverse application needs.

### Application Scenarios

- **Industrial Pure Water Monitoring**: Particularly suitable for low-conductivity fluids such as industrial pure water, solving instability issues found with electromagnetic flow meters in this scenario.  
- **Flow and Temperature Management in Mold Temperature Controllers**: Real-time monitoring of medium flow and temperature optimizes pump speed and valve control, ensuring uniform mold temperature and improving product quality.

## Solution 2: Real-Time Water Flow Monitoring with Flow Switches

![Flow Switch](http://image.sentinel-china.com/202401191053665.png)

### Principle and Features

The flow switch operates on the thermal dispersion principle, detecting the flow status of fluid in a pipeline and providing fast-response switch signal output.  
Its simple structure and stable performance make it ideal for cooling and lubrication systems.

### Product Highlights

- **Real-Time Water Flow Status Monitoring**: Using the thermal dispersion principle, the flow switch can accurately detect the presence of water flow in the pipeline. When flow falls below the preset value, it quickly issues an alarm to protect system operation.  
- **304/316L Stainless Steel Construction**: Housing is made of 304 stainless steel; probe is made of food-grade 316L stainless steel—corrosion-resistant, hygienic, and suitable for industrial cooling water, lubricating oil, and various other media.  
- **User-Friendly Design**: Equipped with a 45° angled LED display panel for clear status indication; switch point can be quickly adjusted via a rotary potentiometer without special tools.  
- **Multiple Output Options**: Supports PNP, NPN, and relay outputs; compatible with various industrial control systems; includes short-circuit and reverse-polarity protection for operational safety.

### Application Scenarios

## Solution Selection Recommendations

1. **Status Monitoring Needs**  
   For real-time detection of fluid flow presence (e.g., in cooling or lubrication systems), the thermal dispersion-based flow switch is recommended for its cost-effectiveness and easy installation.

2. **Accurate Measurement Needs**  
   For high-precision flow and temperature measurement, especially in industrial pure water or mold temperature control applications, the compact vortex flow sensor is recommended for its adaptability and intelligent communication capabilities that meet Industry 4.0 requirements.

3. **Hybrid Scenarios**  
   For complex industrial systems requiring a comprehensive solution:  
   - Use the flow switch for status monitoring.  
   - Use the vortex flow sensor for high-precision measurement and data logging.
