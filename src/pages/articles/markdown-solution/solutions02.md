## Split-Type Level Sensor Solves Foam Interference and Space Constraints in Dairy Tank Level Measurement

In the dairy processing industry, accurate monitoring of tank liquid levels is not only linked to production efficiency but also directly impacts product quality and safety. A dairy plant client encountered a series of tricky problems when monitoring the liquid level in a milk tank.

Initially, they planned to use a **standard ultrasonic level sensor**, **but in actual operation, they found that the large amount of foam generated during milk stirring or filling severely interfered with the ultrasonic signal, resulting in highly unstable measurements**.

When they tried a **differential pressure level sensor**, **a new problem arose—difficulty in cleaning**. Dairy production has extremely high hygiene requirements, and each tank cleaning must be thorough and residue-free. The **complex structure of the differential pressure sensor makes it difficult to dismantle and clean**, which became a new pain point.

After multiple failed attempts, the customer switched to a **float-type level sensor**. However, new troubles followed. The float probe rod was fixed to the top of the tank, and when the tank lid needed to be opened for manual stirring or inspection, the rod became an obstacle—hindering operation and posing safety hazards.

The combination of these issues forced the customer to seek a more professional solution. When they approached SENTINEL Electronics, we decided to help them rethink the path of liquid level measurement and jointly provided a **solution to address foam interference and space constraints in dairy tanks**.

## Ingenious Design: An Innovative “Bottom-Up” Approach

Upon receiving the customer’s request, our technical team immediately organized an in-depth discussion and on-site evaluation. Faced with the multiple constraints above, we realized that traditional level sensor installation methods could no longer meet this working condition.

Since the tank’s top space was limited, the cleaning requirements were strict, and foam interference needed to be avoided, why not consider starting from the bottom of the tank?

SENTINEL’s split-type level sensor has a key advantage—its probe supports bidirectional measurement. This means that, unlike traditional sensors that measure from top to bottom, we can accurately measure from the bottom up. This feature opened new possibilities for installation.

However, implementation was not easy. The space at the bottom of the customer’s tank was extremely limited, making it impossible to install a conventional integrated level sensor. We quickly proposed a **split-type** custom solution: insert the split probe from the top of the tank, but mount it at the bottom, with the electronics module connected to the probe via cable and flexibly installed outside the equipment.

This structure met the need for bottom-up measurement, perfectly avoided interference from the limited top space, and made maintenance and cleaning easier. All parts could be disassembled independently and sanitized separately, greatly improving hygiene management convenience and efficiency.

## Cost Reduction & Efficiency Gain: Not Just Level, but Temperature Too

In addition to liquid level measurement, we equipped the customer with a probe module that also has temperature monitoring capabilities. By integrating a high-precision temperature sensor into the probe, the customer could monitor the milk tank temperature in real time without installing an additional temperature probe.

This integration not only reduced costs but also simplified system wiring and maintenance. For the customer, this seemingly small change brought huge value—they no longer needed to purchase a separate temperature monitoring system or worry about cleaning extra sensors, making on-site operations simpler and more efficient.

## Creating Value: More than Just a Sensor—It’s Capability

Through this case, we not only solved the customer’s immediate problem but also demonstrated our comprehensive capabilities in product customization, technical implementation, and customer responsiveness. From product design and structural innovation to project delivery, **the entire process took just one month**.

We proved through action that we are not just a sensor supplier—we are a **solutions partner for optimizing on-site processes**.

This cooperation allowed the customer to truly realize that “a sensor is not a universal part, but a tool tailored to match on-site conditions.” Our technical team continues to create real value for the era of smart manufacturing through one customized solution after another.
