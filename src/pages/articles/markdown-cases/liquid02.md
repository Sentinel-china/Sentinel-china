With the rapid development of industrial automation, various sensors are playing an increasingly important role in industrial production. As a core component of industrial automation, hydraulic systems require critical monitoring of the fluid level and temperature within the tank. To meet this need, our company proudly introduces the **Level/Temperature Integrated Float-Type Sensor**, designed to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution for hydraulic systems.

## What is a Float-Type Level Sensor?

A float-type level sensor is a device that detects liquid levels through the up-and-down movement of a float. The float contains a magnet, and as the liquid level changes, the float moves with the surface of the liquid. The sensor detects changes in the float's position through magnetic-sensitive elements (such as Hall effect sensors or magnetoresistive sensors), accurately measuring the level. This sensor is widely used in various industrial applications due to its simple structure, high reliability, and strong anti-interference capabilities.

The working principle of a float-type level sensor can be summarized as **"magnetic float tracking"**: the movement of the float alters the magnetic field, and the response of magnetic-sensitive elements outputs a signal representing the level change. Due to the float's direct contact with the liquid, it accurately reflects the dynamic changes of the liquid, making it particularly suitable for monitoring liquid media.

## Features of Float-Type Level Sensors

- **Simple Structure and Reliable Performance**: The float-type level sensor is simple in both design and operation, resulting in low failure rates and stable performance in harsh industrial environments.
- **High-Precision Measurement**: The sensor provides highly accurate level readings by directly contacting the liquid, with a resolution of up to 5mm.
- **Strong Anti-Interference Ability**: By detecting changes in the magnetic field through magnetic-sensitive elements, the sensor is minimally affected by electrical interference and noise, making it suitable for complex industrial environments.
- **Wide Range of Applications**: Float-type level sensors are widely used in industries such as chemical, petroleum, pharmaceutical, and food processing. They are especially suitable for monitoring levels in hydraulic tanks, storage tanks, and reservoirs.
- **Durable Materials**: These sensors are usually made of corrosion-resistant materials, such as stainless steel or high-strength plastic, allowing them to be used long-term in corrosive liquids, oils, sewage, and other media.

In response to market demand, we have launched the **Level/Temperature Integrated Float-Type Sensor**, which combines level and temperature monitoring with the following key features:

- **Dual Display of Level/Temperature**: This sensor can simultaneously display level and temperature data, providing precise numerical values that help monitor the working temperature of the tank in real-time.
- **High Precision and Resolution**: The level measurement resolution is 5mm, accurately reflecting level changes to ensure that the liquid in the tank remains within a safe range. The temperature measurement accuracy is 0.5Â°C, meeting stringent industrial temperature monitoring requirements.
- **Flexible Output and Settings**: The level and temperature signals of the sensor support PNP/NPN/push-pull outputs, and users can set normally open or normally closed states according to their needs. Additionally, the temperature signal supports 4...20mA output, ensuring stable and compatible data transmission.
- **IO-Link Digital Transmission**: The product is equipped with an advanced IO-Link digital communication interface, significantly enhancing measurement accuracy and anti-interference capabilities. Through IO-Link, the sensor can seamlessly connect with PLC and other devices, enabling digital data transmission and remote settings, greatly enhancing the convenience of automated management.
- **Robust and Durable Design**: Both the housing and probe of this product are made of 304 stainless steel, allowing stable operation in harsh working environments. The probe length can be customized according to customer needs, ensuring suitability for tanks or reservoirs of different sizes. The float is made of NBR material, providing excellent oil resistance and wear resistance.
- **Easy Installation and Cost Savings**: By integrating level and temperature monitoring into one, the sensor saves the cost of purchasing and installing two separate sensors, reducing maintenance complexity. In hydraulic station applications, this sensor saves time and money, enhancing production efficiency.

## Conclusion

Our **Level/Temperature Integrated Float-Type Sensor** offers a highly advantageous solution for hydraulic systems, achieving efficient level and temperature monitoring while significantly reducing equipment costs and installation complexity through integrated design. With advanced IO-Link technology, high-precision measurement capabilities, and robust structural design, this sensor provides reliable support for various industrial automation applications.
