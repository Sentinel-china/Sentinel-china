In the field of industrial automation, monitoring fluid flow has always been a basic yet crucial task. The cooling systems of some large equipment often need to monitor the flow of cooling water in dozens of pipes simultaneously, requiring an economical and durable flow switch.

Today, I will introduce to you a very suitable product for such application scenarios from SENTINEL — the "New Type Flow Sensor."

## Product Iteration Upgrade Comparison

The PLSX series flow sensors have always been SENTINEL's best-selling products, winning widespread acclaim in the market for their reliability and efficiency. However, as customer use cases continue to expand, we have found that the performance of the original products needs to be further improved in some particularly harsh environments. For this reason, we have launched a new "New Type Flow Sensor."

This new sensor retains the excellent functions of the PLSX series while undergoing significant iteration upgrades in appearance and materials. We have especially strengthened its shell design, using all stainless steel materials to enhance durability in harsh environments. At the same time, considering the convenience of operation, the sensor's monitoring panel is designed with a 45° angle, equipped with a bright LED display, making it easier for users to monitor the switch status.

Through these careful design improvements, the new "New Type Flow Sensor" not only continues the stability of the PLSX series but also prepares for more harsh industrial environments. We believe this upgraded product will provide customers with a more comprehensive and reliable flow monitoring solution.

## Product Features

- **Thermal Dispersion Principle**: This flow sensor works based on the thermal dispersion principle, mainly used to monitor whether water flows in the pipeline. PNP, NPN, and relay multiple outputs are available, with built-in reverse polarity and short circuit protection. It can provide reliable monitoring of water flow in the pipeline.

- **304 Stainless Steel Shell**: The sensor's shell is made of 304 stainless steel material, with a moderate outer diameter of 50mm. It ensures its durability and stability in various industrial environments.

- **316L Stainless Steel Probe**: The probe uses food-grade 316L stainless steel material, ensuring the safety and hygiene of contact with the fluid. Moreover, it can adapt to various adapters, making this sensor flexible for different pipeline systems, greatly enhancing its applicability.

- **Rotary Potentiometer Adjustment**: The adjustment of the switch point is completed by rotating the potentiometer, making the adjustment process very simple and intuitive. Users can easily adjust the switch point to suit different working conditions, without the need for professional tools or complicated operations.

- **45° Panel and LED Strip**: The sensor is equipped with a 45° inclined panel, making the display interface easier to read. A three-color LED strip intuitively displays the switch status, making it easy for users to recognize the working condition of the device, further improving monitoring efficiency.

## Example: Flow Monitoring in Metallurgical Industry Equipment

A domestic metallurgical equipment manufacturer has been using our PLSX series flow sensors for water flow monitoring on the production line. This series of products has won high praise from customers with a record of **zero failure rate in five years**. This time, we recommended the "New Type Flow Sensor" to the customer, which not only inherits the reliability and stability of the PLSX series but also ensures its competence in more stringent industrial environments through its upgraded design and materials. For example, in the chemical processing process, the "New Type Flow Sensor" demonstrates superior chemical corrosion resistance thanks to its optimized material selection. In industrial environments with weak acids and bases, the "New Type Flow Sensor" can also provide accurate and reliable flow monitoring.
