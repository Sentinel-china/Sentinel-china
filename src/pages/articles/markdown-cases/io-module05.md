## Application of SENTINEL Products in Powder Metallurgy Furnaces

The operation of powder metallurgy sintering furnaces involves various critical factors such as **temperature, pressure, and flow rate**. Precisely monitoring these parameters is crucial for product quality. SENTINEL Electronics' high-performance sensors and intelligent solutions provide stable support in different industrial environments, ensuring sintering furnaces maintain optimal conditions during production.

### Flow Switch × Vacuum Sintering Furnace Cooling System

In the cooling system of a vacuum sintering furnace, the **flow switch** plays a critical role. By accurately monitoring the flow of cooling liquid, it can detect abnormalities in time, preventing equipment overheating. Overheating not only affects the furnace's lifespan but also impacts temperature uniformity during sintering, affecting final product quality.

SENTINEL's flow switch uses the **thermal loss principle** for monitoring, offering high precision and reliability. It supports multiple output options (PNP, NPN, relay) and is adaptable to various control needs. The probe is made of **304 stainless steel**, suitable for different cooling fluids and conditions.

### Pressure Sensor × Pressure System of Sintering Furnace

In high-pressure sintering furnaces, the **pressure sensor** monitors internal gas pressure, ensuring atmospheric stability during sintering. Precise control improves material density and consistency and prevents quality issues from abnormal pressure.

SENTINEL's pressure sensors have a **-1 to 600 bar** range and offer high-precision real-time data. They support switch, analog, and IO-Link outputs. With **IO-Link technology**, they enable remote transmission and fault diagnostics for enhanced stability.

### Temperature Sensor × Rapid Cooling Furnace Cooling System

In rapid cooling furnaces, the **temperature sensor** measures cooling liquid temperature, optimizing cooling rate for uniformity and stability. Cooling that's too fast or too slow can cause internal stress, reducing final product quality.

SENTINEL's Pt1000 platinum resistance temperature sensor ensures **high precision and long-term stability**. With **IO-Link integration**, it supports remote setup and real-time monitoring, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

### Signal Acquisition Box × Vacuum Sintering Furnace Signal Collection
