## Introduction
In modern industrial automation, **accurate flow measurement** is essential for ensuring production efficiency and quality.  
**Vortex flow sensors**, known for their precision, stability, and reliability, play a vital role in many applications.

SENTINEL Electronics Co., Ltd., based in Tianjin, is about to launch a **small-sized vortex flow sensor** that retains the advantages of traditional designs while innovating in **size, functionality, and ease of use**.



## What is a Vortex Flow Sensor
A **vortex flow sensor** measures flow using the **von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex street** principle.  
When fluid flows past a non-streamlined obstacle, vortices form alternately on both sides. The **vortex shedding frequency** is proportional to fluid velocity, enabling accurate flow calculation.
