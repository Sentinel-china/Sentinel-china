## From Fieldbus to Industrial Ethernet

## Fieldbus

![Fieldbus Overview](https://www.sentinel-china.com/vancheerfile/Images/2023/7/20230704103738772.png)

In the era of Industry 4.0 intelligence, the booming development of various communication technologies has brought many possibilities for enterprises to achieve intelligence and automation. Especially in the intelligent manufacturing industry, it is necessary to access different equipment and systems through various communication methods on the workshop floor, and collect and upload massive data. At present, in the field of industrial control, the most widely used technologies in the workshop floor are industrial Ethernet technology and industrial fieldbus technology, which provide strong support for factories to achieve automation.

Fieldbus refers to a digital, serial, multi-point communication data bus between field devices installed in manufacturing or process areas and controllers in the control room. It is an industrial data bus and is a bottom-up data communication network in the automation field. Simply put, fieldbus replaces the transmission of traditional 4-20mA analog signals and ordinary switch signals and is connected to a fully digital, bi-directional, and multi-station communication system for intelligent field devices and automation systems.

Constrained by the technology level at that time, products from various manufacturers were self-contained systems. These fieldbus had their own characteristics and specific application ranges. However, due to the wide variety and different communication protocols, the standardization of fieldbus posed certain difficulties. People started to seek new industrial communication solutions, and Ethernet technology appeared on the horizon.

## Industrial Ethernet

Ethernet was originally designed for office automation and did not consider the needs of industrial environments. It cannot meet the requirements of the industrial field in material selection, product strength, applicability, real-time performance, interoperability, reliability, anti-interference, and intrinsic safety. Therefore, industrial Ethernet, which is different from commercial Ethernet, is used in industrial field control applications. Industrial Ethernet refers to the relevant components and technologies of Ethernet applied in industrial automation control and process control in industrial environments. It adopts TCP/IP protocol and is compatible with IEEE 802.3 standard, and communication technology of its own unique protocol is added at the application layer.

## SENTINEL Remote I/O Products

SENTINEL is one of the few manufacturers in China that independently researches and develops industrial fieldbus products. With years of accumulated technology and production expertise, a professional R&D team and technical support personnel, we have transitioned from fieldbus products to the current industrial Ethernet I/O modules and IO-Link series products. We are fully aware of the difficulties involved in developing a new product, but we have always persisted and grounded ourselves in research and development.

Our products are widely used in the fields of new energy, intelligent manufacturing, etc. Through technical research and development and innovation, we have formed products based on industrial Ethernet and IO-Link distributed I/O modules, fluid process monitoring sensors, cable connectors, and so on. SENTINEL has always adhered to customer needs-oriented and has been recognized by the industry with the long-standing tolerance, trust, and support of its customers.

IP67 series modules, with a high-strength glass fiber reinforced plastic shell and metal connectors, are completely sealed and protected against impact and vibration. They ensure reliable and stable operation even in harsh environments. With two 7/8" power interfaces, two Ethernet interfaces with built-in switches, and eight M12 I/O interfaces, these modules provide 16 digital inputs/outputs with a single point output current of 0.5A for sensor and actuator installation close to the field. They meet the requirements for on-site installation applications.

In 2021, our company launched the IP20 series compact module. This series of products is more cost-effective, with a compact metal casing structure that can not only be installed in a control cabinet but also used in integrated small distributed control boxes. Similarly, it comes with a built-in switch and two RJ45 network ports for convenient wiring. It also has 32-point digital input/output, which can be configured as NPN or PNP, and input/output signals can be sent to the field network.

In addition, we are also working hard to research and develop analog I/O modules, and we will soon meet with you all!

For many years, we have always adhered to the principle of "customer first", constantly innovating to meet the needs of customers. Our professional after-sales team solves all worries for customers, and SENTINEL is willing to become your trustworthy partner.
