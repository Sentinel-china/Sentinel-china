I am the Electrical Manager of a domestic pharmaceutical company. The company is a comprehensive drug production enterprise specializing in large infusion, ampoule injection, eye drops, nutrition infusion, and other products. It possesses multiple advanced technology production lines, such as the soft bag large infusion production line, ampoule production line, and packaging production line.

At the invitation of [company/contact], today I would like to discuss my experience using the **SENTINEL remote IO module**.

## Industrial Manufacturing and Product Selection

In this construction project, we needed to centrally monitor multiple conveyor equipment and their operating status. After comparing products from several domestic companies, contacting their technical support, and trying their products, I ultimately gave the highest evaluation to **SENTINEL**.

Their product is **easy to install and wire** in terms of hardware structure design, and the software is also very easy to use. This has greatly saved me time and resources in subsequent projects.

In terms of product selection, we ultimately used the **Mitsubishi FX5U series PLC**, in conjunction with SENTINEL's **CC-Link IE Field Basic protocol CMBC series distributed modules**. This choice undoubtedly **significantly improved my work efficiency**.

## Application Experience and Effectiveness

I use this module for **distributed site layout**, directly accessing on-site equipment status signals and sensors. During debugging and use, I found that signal collection and control output are **very smooth**, and communication with PLC systems via **TCP/IP network** greatly reduces the amount of wiring needed for central control.

This approach **speeds up construction progress** and **saves cable and labor costs**.

## Communication and Service Experience

Choosing **SENTINEL** was also due to their **excellent communication and response speed**. During the contact process, I felt the strong capability of SENTINEL's R&D team and technical after-sales team.

For example, through communication with technical staff, I gained a better understanding of the **product characteristics** of the CMBC series modules. During the product usage process, any issues I encountered were quickly addressed by the team with detailed answers.

The **technical documentation** they provided was thorough and easy to navigate. I believe that choosing SENTINEL means choosing **reliable technical support and after-sales service**.

## Summary and Suggestions

Through communication and cooperation with the SENTINEL team, I am **very satisfied** with their products and services. The product performance is stable and reliable, the team is professional, and the service is considerate.

I believe that in future work, I will continue to choose SENTINEL.

Finally, I hope SENTINEL can develop **scalable remote IO** in the future, which can greatly improve the flexibility of on-site IO point layout.
