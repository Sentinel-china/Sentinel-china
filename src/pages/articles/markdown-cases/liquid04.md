### 316L Stainless Steel Probe for Hygienic Applications
The THH06E-G1/4-Lxx-IL-SC temperature probe is made of 316L stainless steel, which offers superior corrosion resistance compared to standard 304 stainless steel. This makes it particularly suitable for applications involving food, pharmaceuticals, and chemical media.

Key features include:
- **Corrosion Resistance to Acids and Alkalis**: Withstands cleaning agents, disinfectants, and harsh chemical environments.
- **Smooth Surface, Easy to Clean**: Minimizes contamination buildup, complying with hygiene standards.
- **High Temperature Resistance for Sterilization**: Suitable for steam sterilization, CIP, and SIP processes.

The probe length is customizable to match specific installation needs.

### High-Precision Temperature Measurement
Uses a Pt1000 sensor element to measure temperatures from -50°C to 150°C (-58°F to 302°F) with an accuracy of ±0.5°C, meeting strict process control requirements such as fermentation and pasteurization.

### IO-Link Smart Communication & 4-20mA Output
Supports IO-Link protocol V1.1 (COM2, 38.4 kbit/s) for:
- Remote monitoring
- Parameter adjustment
- Device diagnostics

Also supports **4-20mA analog output** for compatibility with traditional control systems.
- **Analog Output Accuracy**: 0.5% F.S  
- Example: For a 200°C span, max deviation is 1°C.

### ISDU (Indexed Service Data Unit)
Allows remote parameter configuration via IO-Link:
- Adjust analog output range
- Retrieve serial number, firmware version, etc.
- Restore factory settings

**Note**: Does not support Block Parameterization or Data Storage (DS).
