## Industrial Automation Flow Monitoring Solutions

Precise flow measurement and real-time monitoring are essential to ensure production efficiency and equipment safety. Tianjin SENTINEL Electronics Co., Ltd. offers two flow monitoring solutions to meet various demands: **Compact Vortex Flow Sensors** and **Flow Switches Based on the Thermal Loss Principle**. This article will analyze the advantages of these two flow sensors in terms of technical features and application scenarios, helping users select the most suitable solution.

### Solution 1: High-Precision Flow Measurement with Vortex Flow Sensors

#### Principles and Features

Vortex flow sensors are based on the Kármán vortex effect, measuring flow by detecting the frequency of vortices generated as fluid passes through an obstacle. This design does not rely on the fluid’s conductivity, making it ideal for measuring water, gas, steam, and other media.

#### Product Features

- **Flow and Temperature Monitoring**: Simultaneously monitors flow and temperature with three flow ranges available (2-16L/min, 5-40L/min, 10-100L/min), a temperature range of 0-100°C, and an accuracy of 3% of full scale and 1°C.
- **High-Resolution IPS Display**: Supports four-direction rotation for clear data reading under complex installation conditions.
- **Standardized Interface and Communication**: Equipped with an M12 A-code 4-pin IO-Link interface for remote parameter settings and real-time data retrieval via ISDU (Index Service).
- **Cumulative Flow Records**: Supports up to 99,999L or m³ for tracking and analysis.
- **Flexible Design**: Offers multiple thread specifications for different pipe diameters, with various switching configurations (NO/NC, NPN/PNP, push-pull) to suit diverse applications.

#### Application Scenarios

- **Industrial Pure Water Monitoring**: Particularly suited for low-conductivity fluids (e.g., industrial pure water), solving the instability issues faced by electromagnetic flowmeters.
- **Flow and Temperature Management in Mold Temperature Machines**: Optimizes pump speed and valve control through real-time monitoring of medium flow and temperature, ensuring uniform mold temperatures and improved product quality.

### Solution 2: Real-Time Water Flow Monitoring with Flow Switches

#### Principles and Features

Flow switches operate on the thermal loss principle, detecting the flow state within pipes and providing fast-response switch signal outputs. Their simple structure and stable performance make them ideal for cooling and lubrication systems.

#### Product Highlights

- **Real-Time Flow Monitoring**: Using thermal loss technology, flow switches precisely detect whether water flow exists in pipes. When flow falls below preset values, the sensor promptly sends an alarm signal, ensuring system safety.
- **304/316L Stainless Steel Material**: The housing uses 304 stainless steel, while the probe is made of food-grade 316L stainless steel, offering corrosion resistance and hygienic safety for applications like industrial cooling water and lubricating oils.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Features a 45° angled LED display panel for clear status visibility and a rotary potentiometer for quick switch point adjustments without special tools.
- **Multiple Output Options**: Supports PNP, NPN, and relay outputs, adapting to various industrial control systems, with built-in short-circuit and reverse polarity protection for safe operation.

#### Application Scenarios

- **Cooling Water Flow Monitoring**: Ensures the proper flow state in dozens of pipes in large cooling systems, preventing equipment damage due to cooling failures.
- **Basic Flow State Monitoring**: Provides economical and efficient solutions for basic monitoring of water or oil flow in industrial equipment.

### Solution Recommendations

1. **Flow State Monitoring Needs**: For real-time monitoring of fluid flow (e.g., cooling and lubrication systems), the thermal loss flow switch is recommended for its cost efficiency and easy installation.
2. **Precise Measurement Needs**: For high-precision flow and temperature measurements, especially in industrial pure water or mold temperature machine applications, the compact vortex flow sensor is ideal due to its adaptability and smart communication features suitable for Industry 4.0.
3. **Mixed Scenarios**: For complex industrial systems requiring combined solutions:
   - Use flow switches for flow state monitoring.
   - Use vortex flow sensors for high-precision measurement and data recording.

### Conclusion

Vortex flow sensors and flow switches are core devices for flow monitoring in industrial automation. Their precision, intelligence, and reliability provide comprehensive solutions for industrial processes.
