# SENTINEL CIOL Series IO-Link to Analog Output Converters  

**In the era of Industry 4.0**, IO-Link technology is transforming device connectivity with its **simple installation**, **reliable communication**, and **powerful remote diagnostics**.  

To help factories **integrate traditional analog actuators** into modern IO-Link networks, **SENTINEL** introduces two new converters:  

- **CIOL-1AO-SC** ‚Äì Single-channel current output  
- **CIOL-2VO-SC** ‚Äì Dual-channel voltage output  

Both offer **smart, efficient analog data handling** for industrial applications.

## Application-Oriented Design  
![CIOL module application scenarios](http://image.sentinel-china.com/202505230844280.png)  

In industries such as **fluid control, process regulation, temperature management, and hydraulics**, many actuators (e.g., **proportional valves, inverters, dampers, proportional pumps**) require **continuous analog signals** for smooth operation.  

The CIOL series bridges the gap by enabling **secure, stable, and intelligent integration** of these analog devices into **IO-Link control systems**, supporting standard **4‚Äì20 mA** and **0‚Äì10 V** signal formats.  

## Benefits of the CIOL Series  
- **Direct integration** of analog devices into IO-Link networks  
- **Enhanced flexibility** and transparency in automation systems  
- Suitable for both **new installations** and **digital retrofits**  
- **Easy deployment** and **low maintenance**  

## Summary  
The **CIOL-1AO-SC** and **CIOL-2VO-SC** converters provide a practical and cost-effective pathway to upgrade traditional analog control systems into **fully networked smart factories**.
