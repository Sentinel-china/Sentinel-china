A mold temperature controller, also known as a mold temperature control unit, is an industrial device used to precisely control the temperature of a mold. It maintains the mold within a specific temperature range by heating or cooling the medium (such as water or oil).  

Core components include:
- Water tank
- Heating and cooling system
- Power transmission system
- Valve control system  

**Applications:**
- **Plastic industry:** Improves molding efficiency, reduces defect rates, enhances product appearance, and saves energy.
- **Die-casting industry:** Reduces casting deformation and defects, prolongs mold life.



## Application of Vortex Flow Sensors in Mold Temperature Controllers

The vortex flow sensor determines flow by measuring the frequency of vortices generated when fluid flows through a pipeline.  
**Key features:**
- Simple structure, no moving parts
- High precision and reliability
- Wide measuring range

**Industrial uses:** process control, energy management, environmental monitoring.

### Flow and Temperature Monitoring
In mold temperature controllers, **precise flow control** is crucial for uniform and stable mold temperature.  

**Functions:**
- Real-time monitoring of flow and temperature
- Feedback to control system for pump speed/valve adjustments
- Maintain optimal heating and cooling process  
- Detect anomalies (blockage, leak, pump failure) early to prevent downtime
