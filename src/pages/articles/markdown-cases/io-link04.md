## What is RTD Input

![RTD Input Diagram](http://image.sentinel-china.com/202411011146221.png)

**RTD input** refers to feeding temperature data from RTD sensors into a data acquisition or control system.  
Common platinum RTDs:
- **Pt100** (100 Œ© at 0 ¬∞C)
- **Pt1000** (1000 Œ© at 0 ¬∞C)

Platinum RTDs offer an excellent linear relationship between temperature and resistance, making them widely used in:
- Industrial production
- Automated process control
- Equipment condition monitoring

## Customer Pain Points ‚Äî Challenges of Bridge Circuit Collection

Traditional **bridge circuit** collection has notable drawbacks:

- **Susceptibility to Cable Resistance**  
  Long-distance wiring affects accuracy due to added cable resistance, temperature variations, and connection inconsistencies.

- **Weak Anti-Interference Performance**  
  Electromagnetic noise in industrial settings easily disturbs bridge circuit signals, requiring extra shielding and filtering.

- **Complex Wiring & High Maintenance**  
  Every cable change or wiring adjustment may require recalibration, leading to increased downtime and cost.

**SENTINEL's IO-Link remote RTD module** directly addresses these issues, offering simpler installation and improved measurement stability.
