The production process of tires involves multiple stages such as raw material processing, forming, vulcanization, and quality inspection. Each stage requires a highly precise control system. Traditional wiring methods have issues such as complex wiring, difficult installation and maintenance, and poor system scalability. To overcome these challenges, bus module products provide customers with more efficient solutions by simplifying wiring, improving system reliability and flexibility, and significantly enhancing the overall efficiency of tire conveyor lines.



## Advantages of Bus Modules

### Suitable for Conveyor Lines: Time and Effort Saving

#### Challenges of Traditional Wiring Methods

In traditional wiring methods, each sensor, actuator, and controller needs separate wiring, which not only increases the complexity of installation and maintenance but also easily causes wiring errors, leading to system failures and downtime. Additionally, traditional wiring methods have poor scalability, and when production demands change, the cost and time for adding or re-wiring are high and time-consuming.

#### Solutions of Bus Modules

Bus modules connect all devices through a unified communication bus, significantly simplifying the wiring process. The main advantages are as follows:

- **Simplified wiring** – Only one communication line is needed to connect multiple devices, reducing the number and complexity of wires  
- **Quick installation** – Modular design and standardized interfaces make the installation process faster, significantly reducing installation time  
- **Flexible expansion** – When the production line needs to expand or adjust, only adding or adjusting the bus module is required without re-wiring, reducing expansion costs and time

### Product Quality Monitoring

Our bus modules undergo strict quality control and testing. Each product is rigorously tested for electromagnetic compatibility (such as surge immunity tests, electrical fast transient burst immunity tests, etc.) during the design phase. Additionally, the company has established a product aging laboratory where each product undergoes continuous power-on aging tests. **The first batch of bus products has undergone 4 years of aging and still operates stably**.

Each product also undergoes **at least 24 hours** of aging testing before leaving the factory to ensure stable operation in various harsh industrial environments. The modules have high interference resistance and strong error detection functions, effectively reducing system failures and downtime, ensuring continuous operation of the production line.



## Application Cases

In a large TBR tire manufacturing enterprise, our CC-Link IE Field Basic protocol bus modules were successfully applied to its conveyor line system. By replacing the original traditional solutions with bus modules, the company's **wiring time was reduced by 40%**, maintenance efficiency improved, and system scalability significantly enhanced.
