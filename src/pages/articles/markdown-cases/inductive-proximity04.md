# Customer Feedback on SENTINEL Products

## First Encounter with SENTINEL
I first came into contact with **SENTINEL** products and was impressed by their **craftsmanship, materials, and quality**—far beyond my expectations for a domestic brand. I even mistook it for a foreign brand at first.

SENTINEL’s **official website** also left a great impression: no annoying ads or pop-ups, just clear product descriptions, professional company introductions, and detailed application scenarios. The overall style reflects **pragmatism and professionalism**.

## Five Years Without Failures – Stable and Reliable
Initially, I had some doubts about quality, since it usually requires years of market validation. However, **SENTINEL’s performance in both testing and real application was outstanding**.  

Over **five years**, the **proximity switches, water flow switches, terminal boxes, distributed I/O** and other products I used had **zero failures**. Compared to **international top brands**, SENTINEL’s performance and lifespan are **on par**, but at a **more competitive price**.

## Issues
In fieldbus solutions, SENTINEL’s devices significantly **reduce wiring workload** and support protocols of most mainstream PLCs, which builds trust.  

However, there are **two areas for improvement**:
- No dedicated **temperature acquisition module** in the bus system. Currently, I have to convert **PT100** signals into **4–20 mA** before integration. A dedicated temperature module compatible with **Type C thermocouples** would be valuable.
- Proximity switches sometimes have **momentary signal interruptions** under strong magnetic interference or high ambient temperatures. Improved **anti-interference capability** is expected.

## Expected Improvements
I hope SENTINEL develops **expandable remote I/O systems** that allow plug-in **digital and analog input/output modules**, enriching the product line and increasing flexibility.

## Online Response & Problem Solving
Their **customer communication** is excellent—always online, responsive, and professional. Even during the **COVID-19** period, they maintained **on-time delivery** with both quantity and quality assured.

## Future Outlook
I look forward to:
- Products that **collect flow and temperature simultaneously** (e.g., a water flow switch with temperature sensing) to save users’ assembly costs.
- Development of **smart gateway products** for **long-distance fieldbus transmission**.
- Continued **expansion of the product line** and enhancement of industrial communication solutions.


**Conclusion:**  
While there are areas for improvement, SENTINEL’s **product quality, performance, and technical support** are already outstanding, making it a **domestic brand to be proud of**. I look forward to seeing even more **innovative and high-quality solutions** from them in the future.
