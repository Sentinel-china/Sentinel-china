## IO-Link Master Modules with Modbus-TCP for Smarter Industrial Connectivity

**In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving industrial automation landscape, on-site device connectivity demands are becoming increasingly diverse.**  
Traditional I/O wiring often leads to complex cabling, tedious debugging, and limited scalability ‚Äî challenges that hinder flexibility and efficiency.

To address these issues, **SENTINEL** introduces two new IO-Link master modules based on the **Modbus-TCP protocol**:  
**ELMT-8IOL-L001** and **ELMT-8IOL-L04B**. From interface configuration to network communication, these modules deliver a more **efficient, flexible, and intelligent** connection solution for modern industrial environments.

## Understanding Modbus-TCP
Modbus-TCP is an Ethernet-based version of the Modbus protocol, widely used for communication between automation devices. Compared to traditional serial Modbus, it:

- Uses the standard **TCP/IP protocol stack**  
- Supports **multi-master communication**  
- Offers **fast data transmission**  
- Provides **flexible network topology**

This makes it an ideal choice for **modern PLCs, I/O modules, and edge devices**.  
The ELMT series master modules leverage this protocol for **direct Ethernet data exchange**, removing the need for dedicated gateways.

## Two Models for Different Needs

| Feature              | ELMT-8IOL-L001 | ELMT-8IOL-L04B |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **IO-Link Port Type** | 8 A-class ports | 4 A-class + 4 B-class (supports external power) |
| **Power Management** | Single supply (up to 8A) | Separate module power (UB) & load power (UL) |
| **Current Distribution** | C1‚ÄìC4 / C5‚ÄìC8: 4A each | C1‚ÄìC2 / C5‚ÄìC6: independent 4A |
| **Protection Level** | IP67, shock & vibration resistant | IP67, resin encapsulated, corrosion resistant |
| **Typical Applications** | Standard IO-Link centralized control | Hybrid scenarios, B-class IO-Link devices |


## High-Efficiency Communication
- **Modbus-TCP protocol**
- Dual **M12 D-coded Ethernet ports** (100 Mbps)  
- Integrated switch for **daisy-chain topology**

## Flexible Configuration
- **PORT_H/PORT_L DIP switches** for port status control
- Supports **DHCP** and **static IP** (default: `192.168.0.*`)

## Easy Maintenance & High Visibility
- **LED status indicators** for power, network, and per-port communication  
- **Disconnection log** per port via Modbus register (e.g., register 30002 = C1)

## Industrial-Grade Reliability
- High-strength **flame-retardant plastic housing**  
- **IP67-rated** for operation in -20¬∞C to +55¬∞C  
- Resistant to dust, water, and vibration
