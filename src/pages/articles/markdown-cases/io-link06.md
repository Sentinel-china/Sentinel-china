## Negative Pressure Distillation Equipment in the Food and Pharmaceutical Industry

In modern **food** and **pharmaceutical** production, **negative pressure distillation equipment** is a key tool for processing heat-sensitive, highly volatile, or high-purity materials.  
Unlike atmospheric pressure distillation, which can degrade product quality due to high temperatures, negative pressure distillation enables **low-temperature processing**, preserving active ingredients and improving product purity.

**Applications:**
- **Food industry:** essential oil extraction, juice concentration, moisture removal.
- **Pharmaceutical industry:** active ingredient extraction, impurity separation, drug solution concentration.

Example: In **natural fragrance** extraction, negative pressure distillation preserves original aroma and active compounds. In pharmaceuticals, low-temperature processing ensures **drug efficacy** and **purity**.

### Operating Principle of Negative Pressure Distillation

Negative pressure distillation lowers system pressure, enabling liquids to **evaporate below their normal boiling point**.

**Process steps:**
1. **Vacuum system setup** ‚Äì Vacuum pump reduces pressure to thousands of Pascals or lower.  
2. **Heating the material** ‚Äì Liquids evaporate at a reduced temperature.  
3. **Steam condensation** ‚Äì Evaporated gas is cooled in a condenser and converted back to liquid.  
4. **Product collection** ‚Äì Condensed liquid is collected, yielding **high-purity separation**.

## Pressure Sensors ‚Äî The Core of Negative Pressure Distillation

### Role in the System
Pressure sensors ensure **stable vacuum conditions**, which directly affect:
- Distillation efficiency
- Product purity
- Active ingredient retention

Even minor pressure fluctuations can compromise **food flavor** or **drug quality**.

### Real-Time Data Feedback
By connecting to a control system, pressure sensors:
- Adjust vacuum pump operation
- Maintain pressure within the target range
- Reduce maintenance costs
- Extend equipment lifespan
