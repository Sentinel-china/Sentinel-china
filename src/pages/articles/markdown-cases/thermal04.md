# **First-time product introduction**

I am a field instrument engineer. In 2022, we are undertaking an industrial silicon furnace project in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, using over 1000 integrated temperature and flow meters of SENTINEL. This is a newly developed product that combines temperature and flow measurement and features a large digital display for remote monitoring, greatly facilitating our work. Each meter has over 200 analog channels that are all connected to SENTINEL acquisition modules and communicate via Modbus and DCS, reducing a great deal of on-site signal lines and saving labor and material costs.

# **Technical Support and Product Performance**

In the early stages of product debugging, I was not familiar with this newly developed product. However, the technicians dispatched by SENTINEL personally came to guide us in debugging, which deepened my understanding of this new product and helped me master on-site calibration skills. Although in the process of using it, I found that the temperature drift of some products was large, I believe that SENTINEL will continue to improve the stability of the product.

During my use of SENTINEL's solution, there were two aspects that made me deeply trust them. First, their telephone support service was very effective. They often conducted follow-up calls to ensure that our needs were met. Secondly, their service was very efficient, with a good attitude and high quality. They were able to promptly resolve some unexpected situations that occurred on-site, and won unanimous praise from our users.

# **Communication Efficiency**

In terms of communication, response time, and problem-solving, SENTINEL's performance is satisfactory. Their communication is timely and their response is fast, fully demonstrating the belief of customer first. They make every effort to solve problems and are very responsible to our owners. They can respond to and handle suggestions we put forth in a timely manner, their service attitude is good, their problem-solving speed is fast, and they patiently explain the requirements and precautions for using new products.

# **Product Improvement and Suggestions**

During the use of the product, I also encountered some problems. For example, I suggest adding protective sleeves to the wiring terminals of the flow meter for easier replacement and repair. In addition, if the signal wires could be replaced with high-temperature resistant shielded wires, I believe the effect would be better.

# **Expectation**

Finally, although there are still some areas needing improvement in the use of the integrated temperature flow meter, their service quality and attention to customers have filled me with confidence. I look forward to seeing SENTINEL continue to improve their products and services in the future and provide us with better solutions.
