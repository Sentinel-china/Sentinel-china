## Acceptance is a delivery node, not the end of risks
![](http://image.sentinel-china.com/1556321.png)

<div style="text-align: justify;">In automation projects, "acceptance pass" is often regarded as an important milestone: equipment debugging is completed, functional verification is error-free, and the production line runs smoothly. From a project management perspective, delivery seems to have been closed-loop. However, in many real-world sites, the real challenges often start from this moment.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">After the equipment enters long-term operation, problems no longer break out intensively, but appear in a more scattered and harder-to-reproduce manner: a certain signal is occasionally abnormal, a certain parameter seems to have been modified, a certain point is sometimes good and sometimes bad, but it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion in a single shutdown inspection. For operation and maintenance personnel, "being able to run" does not mean "easy to maintain", let alone "transferable".</div>

## What consumes the most in the operation and maintenance phase are those "unexplainable" issues.

<div style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to expectations, the most energy-consuming part of the operation and maintenance phase is usually not obvious major faults such as motor burnout or module damage, but some "indescribable" abnormalities: After the equipment has been running for several months, a certain sensor starts to fluctuate, but it is difficult to determine whether it is due to changes in working conditions, parameter drift, or occasional interference caused by aging cables.</div> <div style="text-align: justify;">Or, during the debugging phase, many temporary modifications were made, but the relevant information was not completely recorded, so when there is a real need to trace back, one can only rely on the memory of on-site personnel.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Such problems are often not fatal but extremely time-consuming. A single troubleshooting may require shutting down the machine, checking wires, verifying drawings, and conducting repeated tests; even if the problem is solved at the moment, it is difficult to confirm whether the hidden danger has been completely eliminated. As a result, operation and maintenance work is forced into a cycle of "repeated confirmation and repeated verification."</div>

## The device has no "system memory", and information will gradually be lost during operation.

<div style="text-align: justify;">From a technical perspective, the equipment does not "become more complex" during the operation and maintenance phase. What truly changes is the completeness and accessibility of information: during the design phase, the structure, signal types, and parameter ranges are usually clear; during the debugging phase, engineers also have a relatively good understanding of the status and behavior of points. However, when the equipment enters long-term operation, if this information is not systematically preserved, it will gradually be lost along with personnel turnover, working condition iterations, and partial modifications.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, what operation and maintenance personnel often face is not a truly "broken" device, but a system with incomplete information. The device is still running, but the key understanding of the device is no longer clear: who it is, what its current parameters are, whether any modifications have been made, whether abnormalities follow a pattern, and whether it has been replaced — these questions are difficult to get direct answers to in the system.</div>

## When on-site equipment "has no identity", operation and maintenance can only rely on experience and guesswork.

<div style="text-align: justify;">In traditional architectures, many on-site devices are just an address or an I/O point in the control system. As for their specific models, current parameters, or whether they have undergone modifications, these details are often not reflected in the system. The result is that operation and maintenance work is highly dependent on personal experience.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Experienced engineers can quickly determine directions based on their memory; however, once there is a personnel change, new maintenance staff have to start from scratch, repeating the same troubleshooting paths. In such cases, even if the equipment itself is reliable, operational risks still exist, and it is difficult to completely avoid them solely relying on systems or processes—because the system lacks inheritable "factual basis".</div>

## What operation and maintenance truly needs is not just "having signals", but "understandable equipment".
![](http://image.sentinel-china.com/1556325.png)

<div style="text-align: justify;">As the complexity of on-site environments increases, more and more projects are coming to realize that what is truly needed during the operation and maintenance phase is not just "whether a signal exists," but more importantly "whether the device status is clear." When on-site equipment has identifiable identity information, readable parameter configurations, and feedback on operating status, the way operation and maintenance is conducted undergoes a fundamental change: first, make judgments based on information before deciding whether to intervene on-site; first locate the port and device, then carry out troubleshooting within a smaller scope and with greater precision.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In practical engineering, this is not an abstract concept. Instead, it requires that information from on-site equipment can enter the control system through a unified interface and be stored in a traceable manner. More and more projects are introducing the IO-Link architecture at the sensor and actuator layer. The purpose is not to "increase system complexity," but to solidify in advance the device information that is most easily lost and most dependent on memory into usable information at the system level.</div>

## What IO-Link changes during the operation and maintenance phase is the "way of information acquisition".
![](http://image.sentinel-china.com/1556326.png)

<div style="text-align: justify;">From an operation and maintenance perspective, the value of IO-Link does not lie in its communication rate or the technical term itself, but in the fact that it enables the information of on-site equipment to be managed systematically: equipment identity, parameter configuration, and operating status no longer exist only in the equipment itself or paper documents, but can be directly obtained in the system. When an abnormality occurs, operation and maintenance personnel first face "information" rather than "guesswork".</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the value of IO-Link is not only reflected in individual sensors but also in the structural design of on-site I/O and substation layers. Through IO-Link sub-stations or IO-Link converters, multiple on-site signals are centrally connected to the system, enabling centralized presentation of port diagnosis, status visualization, and parameter readability. This makes operational efficiency very intuitive: there is no longer a need to blindly check circuits point by point or rely entirely on empirical inference. Instead, positioning is first completed at the system level, and then decisions are made on whether shutdown is required, whether replacement is needed, or whether process conditions need to be reviewed.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Equally important is the ability to save and restore parameters. After equipment replacement or maintenance, if the system can help restore the existing configuration, it can significantly reduce the uncertainty caused by human differences. From this perspective, IO-Link devices are more like establishing a transferable "system memory" for the site, making maintenance work no longer strongly tied to the experience of a single person.</div>

## This is particularly crucial in the case of existing equipment and renovation projects.

<div style="text-align: justify;">The ideal "brand-new system" is not common. More often, what we see on-site are production lines that have been running for many years, equipment that has undergone multiple rounds of partial modifications, and constantly changing personnel structures. Incomplete documentation and difficulty in tracing historical modifications are almost the norm.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In the process of supporting customers in equipment modification and system optimization, we have also seen a more pragmatic and effective approach: instead of pursuing "full intelligence" in one go, we start with key points, prioritizing the transformation of the parts that are most prone to problems and most dependent on experience into manageable and traceable structures. As long as IO-Link supported sensors and I/O modules are introduced at the field level, it is often possible to significantly improve the controllability of subsequent operation and maintenance without large-scale modifications to the original control system: the status is more visible, parameters are more accessible, handovers are smoother, and long-term operation and maintenance costs are easier to reduce.</div>

## A good system should make operation and maintenance more sustainable.

<div style="text-align: justify;">From a long-term perspective, a mature automated system is not just about "keeping the equipment running stably"; it should also maintain clarity and manageability continuously during the operation and maintenance phase. True efficiency improvement is reflected not only in equipment performance indicators but also in whether information can be correctly transmitted, continuously retained, and inherited.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">When a system can reduce its reliance on personal experience, operation and maintenance can shift from "fighting fires" to "predictable management". This is also one of the deep-seated reasons why more and more engineering projects choose the IO-Link architecture at the on-site level.</div>
