## A cooling branch transformation from "checking the watch" to "checking the data"

In the powder metallurgy industry, pressure sintering furnaces are often the most expensive and high-risk equipment in the entire production line. When people talk about them, they are used to first looking at the formula, heating curve, and vacuum degree, and rarely focus their energy on the few cooling water pipes next to them. The experience of a certain factory over the past two years just shows what kind of troubles can be caused by neglecting the cooling system.

This pressure sintering furnace often shuts down due to "overheat protection" during high-load production. The temperature program seems to meet the recipe requirements, and there are no obvious abnormalities in the heating elements or the vacuum system, but it always shuts down intermittently. Maintenance personnel have checked the electric heating elements, power controllers, and temperature control parameters repeatedly, but they still cannot find the real "root cause". They can only temporarily alleviate the problem by replacing the pump, cleaning the heat exchanger, and replacing the filter element in advance.

It was not until a maintenance window that the team carefully examined the cooling system itself: there was only one pointer-type pressure gauge on the main cooling pipe, one glass thermometer each on the inlet and outlet pipes of the furnace body, and a mechanical pressure switch at the water pump outlet for under-pressure interlocking. Hardly anyone checked these meters in normal times, and there were no historical curves available for analysis afterward. The workshop supervisor proposed that, without major modifications to the PLC, they hoped to "see clearly" the key variables and conduct correlation analysis with the furnace temperature, which led to this small modification based on IO-Link.

## Project idea: First, digitize this "line" of cooling.

First, the engineer abstracts the cooling system into a simple line: the water pump draws water, which passes through the filter element and plate heat exchanger, enters the furnace cooling jacket, and then returns to the water tank or cooling tower. Around this line, the three most critical quantities are: flow rate, pressure, and temperature.

The flow rate determines the upper limit of cooling capacity. When the flow rate is insufficient, the local temperature rises, and the heat load on the furnace structure and seals accumulates continuously in invisible places. Pressure reflects whether the pipeline is unobstructed; underpressure often indicates cavitation, leakage, or a closed valve, while a slow increase is more likely due to a clogged filter element or fouling in the heat exchanger. Temperature, on the other hand, measures the cooling effect itself: the inlet water temperature represents the quality of the cold source, and the return water temperature as well as the temperature difference between inlet and outlet water reflect how much heat is being removed under the current operating conditions.

The first step of the transformation is to select appropriate positions to add sensors around these three quantities, upgrade the cooling system from "several mechanical watches" to a "traceable digital channel", and then connect it to the existing control system via IO-Link.

## Implementation on the cooling water side: arrangement and connection of three types of sensors

On the main pipe, the team installed a process pressure sensor and a vortex flow sensor at the outlet of the water pump to monitor the system's base pressure and total flow in real time, replacing the original mechanical pressure switch. In this way, any load change, water pump performance degradation, or valve misoperation will leave traces on the trend curve.

On the branch before entering the furnace body, the engineer added a flow switch and an insertion-type temperature sensor. The flow switch is responsible for low-flow alarm and interlock shutdown of the furnace for this branch. The temperature sensor monitors the temperature of the cooling water entering the furnace body to prevent the cold source temperature from quietly rising without being noticed. On the return water pipe of the furnace body, another temperature sensor is arranged to measure the return water temperature, which is paired with the inlet water temperature to analyze the heat exchange intensity.

These newly added sensors uniformly adopt the IO-Link interface, and a single IO-Link master station provides data to the PLC via the PROFINET protocol. The original mechanical pressure switches are connected to the digital inputs of the IO-Link slave stations, retaining the original safety link. In this way, the cooling branch forms a continuous digital monitoring link from the pump outlet to the furnace body return water.

## Implementation on the furnace side: Organize the "temperature map" using an IO-Link thermocouple substation

There were originally more than a dozen thermocouples installed inside the pressure sintering furnace. The main control thermocouple for process control is connected to the original manufacturer's temperature controller, and several monitoring thermocouples are separately connected to the thermocouple module of the PLC. As the number of measuring points increases, the compensation wires and modules in the control cabinet become very crowded, the cost of expanding the number of points is relatively high, and parameter maintenance is also quite laborious.

This transformation introduced IO-Link thermocouple sub-stations, which uniformly connect all thermocouples used for monitoring to the sub-station terminals. The sub-stations internally perform cold junction compensation and linearization, and then send the digitized temperature values to the PLC through the IO-Link master station. Each channel has a clear name and range configuration in the engineering software, such as "Zone 3 Monitoring TC1" and "Furnace Top Monitoring TC2". At the same time, the filtering time and alarm thresholds can be set.

Doing so has three direct benefits. First, a large number of compensation wires are connected to the substation nearby, which greatly simplifies the cables and terminal blocks in the control cabinet. Second, channel parameters are maintained centrally, so in the future, when copying to equipment of the same model, you only need to import the configuration. Third, when replacing or adding thermocouples, you only need to connect the wires in the substation and enable the channel, without expanding the PLC module.

More importantly, when the flow rate, pressure, temperature on the cooling water side, and multiple point temperatures inside the furnace are all connected via IO-Link, engineers can view the cooling status curve and the furnace temperature curve simultaneously on the same screen, truly putting "heating" and "cooling" into a logical closed-loop for analysis.

## Operation effect: Overheating shutdown changes from "guessing the problem" to "watching the trend"

After the renovation, the workshop conducted a comparative analysis of several typical "overheating" incidents. In the past, only a higher temperature or slow temperature drop in a certain heating zone could be observed, making it difficult for engineers to determine whether the problem was with the heating side, process parameters, or cooling capacity. Now, through historical curves, the complete picture before and after the occurrence of the incidents can be clearly seen.

During an abnormality in the heat preservation phase, the trend curve showed that: the branch flow slightly decreased for a certain period of time, the return water temperature remained high, the pressure difference before and after the filter element rose slowly, and at the same time, the furnace temperature in this area dropped more slowly. Based on these curves, the maintenance team quickly determined that it was "insufficient local cooling caused by filter element blockage". After shutting down the furnace to replace the filter element and descaling some pipelines, similar problems in the subsequent period significantly decreased.

The maintenance strategy for the cooling system has also changed accordingly. In the past, filter element replacement mainly relied on experience and time cycles, but now, based on the trends of pressure difference and flow rate, reasonable early warning thresholds are set to achieve "condition-based maintenance". When commissioning new products, process engineers will also consciously observe changes in cooling conditions during different work steps to avoid arranging the most temperature-sensitive processes when operating at the edge of cooling capacity.

Overall, this renovation didn't involve major changes. Only a few sensors and an IO-Link thermocouple substation were added at key positions, yet it made the originally vague relationship between the cooling system and furnace temperature visible, analyzable, and traceable, greatly enhancing the controllability of equipment operation.

## Conclusion: Starting from a branch road, incorporate cooling into process management

The lesson from this project is that the cooling system of the pressure sintering furnace is entirely worthy of being managed as part of the process, rather than simply regarded as an auxiliary facility that "only needs an uninterrupted water supply". By selecting a key cooling branch, reasonably arranging flow, pressure, and temperature sensors, and cooperating with the IO-Link thermocouple substation to integrate the multi-point temperatures inside the furnace into the same data system, the equipment can be upgraded from "relying on experience by reading meters" to "making decisions based on data" without major modifications to the PLC architecture.

For factories that are planning a new furnace or considering cooling system upgrades, there's no need to pursue "full coverage" right from the start. Begin with the most critical branch, a few sensors, and an IO-Link substation. First, gain a clear understanding of a small section of the cooling system, then gradually replicate this to the entire equipment or even the whole workshop. This approach is both reliable and allows for continuous observation of benefits.
